Project radar bounding box to pixel-mercator
Calculate max-zoom-level tiles inside radar bounding box
For each tile inside the radar coverage area
	Test tile for intersection with other radar coverage areas
	For each pixel in tile
		Convert pixel coordinates from mercator to lat/lon
		For each candidate radar site
			Convert coordinates from lat/lon to radial/distance
			Locate nearest radar bins and
			  calculate [interpolated] radar sensed value
			Calculate mosaic weighting for this radar site
		Perform reduction on weighted radar values
		  for all candidate sites
		Store pixel radar datum
